README for Perl extension CPAN::Cpanorg::Auxiliary

NAME
CPAN::Cpanorg::Auxiliary - Methods used in cpan.org infrastructure

USAGE
    use CPAN::Cpanorg::Auxiliary;

DESCRIPTION
The objective of this library is to provide methods which can be used to
write replacements for programs used on the CPAN master server and
stored in github.com in the perlorg/cpanorg and devel/cpanorg-generators
repositories.

In particular, each of those repositories has an executable program with
subroutines identical, or nearly so, to subroutines found in a program
in the other. Those programs are:

*   cpanorg-generators: bin/perl-sorter.pl
    <https://github.com/devel/cpanorg-generators/blob/master/bin/perl-sorter.pl>

*   cpanorg: bin/cpanorg_perl_releases
    <https://github.com/perlorg/cpanorg/blob/master/bin/cpanorg_perl_releases>

By extracting these subroutines into a single package, we hope to
improve the maintainability of code running on the CPAN infrastructure.

METHODS

See documentation for individual methods.  After installation:
